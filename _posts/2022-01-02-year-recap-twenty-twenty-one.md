# Year 2021
I feel that last year came as both a blessing and curse(not that hard to guess, right?) to me. I got a lot of free time last year due to online classes. This free time allowed me to really explore a lot of things on my own. This year also taught me a lot of things, tuaght me how to better appriciate things that I have in present. But here I will mostly Write about technical/programming aspect of 2021.

# Python
I focoused most of my 2021 in first learning [python][1] and then in trying to master it. It is such an accessible language that it makes me happy to see its (unsurprising) ever-increasing popularity. [While in the zen of python][2] it is written that
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it

it is more or less false(for better or worse) in my opinion. Python is one of the most flexible language with very less "magic"(at least compared to ruby). With an easy to understand concept of objects and same ease to change those same objects really make it a beginner friendly language.
I have written in past about some python features in the past
