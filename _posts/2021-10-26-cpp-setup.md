# New to programming?

Are you new to programming and want to start with C++ or C or just want to set up GCC on Windows, but online videos and everything is too complicated(at least that was my experience), then this is exactly for you. \
Now let's start with the simplest way.

# minGW

Visit [this site][1], open the directory with the latest version of minGW GCC and download the `.7z` file. After downloading, extract it into a folder. If you don't have any application to extract `.7z`, I recommend downloading [7zip][2] for that. \
Now copy/cut the extracted directory it should be named `gcc-xx.x.x-no-debug`, to anywhere you want or not, it doesn't really matter. After that go inside `gcc-xx.x.x-no-debug/bin`, gcc.exe g++ should be inside here. Copy the absolute location.\
Now add this path as instructed here [here][3]. Open new instance of the terminal and run `gcc --version` to check the version of gcc, and now you are ready to compile c and c++ programs.

# MSYS2
Simply go to [MSYS2's official site][4] and follow all the [instructions mentioned here][5]. Either add `./minGW/bin` directory present inside main directory MSYS2 to path as mentioned in [previous section][6], if not you can anlways use `gcc` or `g++` using MSYS2 terminal itself.

# Code::Blocks
Visit [codeblocks.org][7], after make your way to [download page][8] and download the file with minGW mentioned. Run the setup and install. By the end of it you will be ready to compile programs.
